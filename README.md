This repository contains a full-stack application built with Spring Boot and React that allows users to manage a list of employees. The backend is implemented in Java using Spring Boot and connects to a MySQL database, while the frontend is implemented in React and communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs. The application features CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for employee records and allows users to search and sort employees by various criteria. This project was developed as a learning exercise and demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, Java, Spring Boot, React, and MySQL.
